## Intentionally empty for deploy safety
# This file is used by the Firebase CLI to inject non‑secret env vars into
# Cloud Run. Keeping it empty avoids conflicts with Secrets (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY).
#
# For local development and emulators, put ALL variables in `.env.local` instead.
# The functions code loads `.env` first, then overlays `.env.local`.
#
# If you need specific non‑secret vars to exist in production runtime, prefer
# migrating them to Firebase Secrets or coordinate setting them outside of `.env`.
